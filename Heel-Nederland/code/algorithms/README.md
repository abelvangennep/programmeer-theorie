# Algorithms

Further explanation of the algorithms we used.

All algorithms:
- Random
- Random with heuristics
- Simulated Annealing
- Simulated Annealing with heuristics

## Random

Our random solution returns a random solution with or without heuristics,
dependent on the users choices.

## Simulated Annealing

Simulated annealing is a probabilistic algorithm, which can calculate a global
optimum. The algorithm compares the scores of two different solutions, even a
worse score can be excepted. To achieve the optimum, three parameters have
to be optimized, the cooling_factor, temperature and end_temperature.

Our simulated annealing algorithm can also be used with heuristics.

The starting point of simulated annealing is with a random solution or random
with heuristics.
